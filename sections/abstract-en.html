<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This ontology has been created to take care of digital objects owned and produced by Cineca Visitlab, the 3D graphic laboratory located in Casalecchio di Reno (BO). The ontology here presented deals with the first of the three hard disks that the project is based upon. The following hard disk's ontologies will be based upon this very ontology in order to testify how a framework can be used and adapted even when the involved files are different. The final result shows an innovative way to take care of digital objects in order to assure them long-term preservation over years.</span>
